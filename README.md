fixing):

### Other (possibly outdated) guides

The guides above have been updated for the latest version of Linux used in this class. There are guides from previous semesters that have not been checked or updated, but that might nevertheless prove to be useful. Again, the guides in this section (and any other guides linked from those guides) **may be outdated or may not work the way they're supposed to** -- use them at your own risk!

> Note: Some of the guides below link to other guides that sound like some of the guides listed above (e.g. another guide on SSH). However, these guides may be outdated. Wherever possible, you should try to use the guides hosted on w4118.github.io!
